Here's **future** Python mini-library that is compatible with its [Java counterpart](https://github.com/xulman/image-net-transfers-java).

It transfers images over a network via ZeroMQ. The protocol documentation, including a bit of
rationale/motivation and example code, can be found as PDFs in the `doc` folder.

Volunteers are welcome!
